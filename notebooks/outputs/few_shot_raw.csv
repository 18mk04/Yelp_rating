"We got here around midnight last Friday... the place was dead. However, they were still serving food and we enjoyed some well made pub grub. Service was friendly, quality cocktails were served, and the atmosphere is derived from an old Uno's, which certainly works for a sports bar. It being located in a somewhat commercial area, I can see why it's empty so late on a Friday. From what my friends tell me - this is a great spot for happy hour, and it stays relatively busy thru 10pm.

*UPDATE - Great patio for day-drinking on the weekends!",4,,False,,
Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!,5,,False,,
"Every friday, my dad and I eat here. We order the same thing... pizza wraps. they are good and fillng. iced tea hits the spot. Typical strip mall pizza.",3,,False,,
"My husband and I were really, really disappointed with our experience at Coulter Infiniti.  We brought our 2006 G37 with barely 34,000 miles (and out of warranty) to have the moon roof looked at.  The moon roof wouldn't open or close, but you could hear the motor working.

After leaving the car there all day we get a call that the car needs a whole new moon roof track - which would cost over $3000.  We contacted their corporate office to attempt to get some or all of the cost covered, due to the fact that it's a big repair and the car  is barely out of warranty.  We were flat out denied.  Twice.  

We were dreading the big repair, and decided to bring the car to a different auto shop (which will get a big, fat 5 star review) for a second opinion.  Turns out the track just had a BUILD UP OF DIRT AND DEBRIS and needed to be cleaned out.  Seriously?!?!  Just over $100 later we were on our way!

I find it VERY hard to believe that Coulter didn't know this was the problem.  We are now searching for a new SUV, and will not be choosing Infiniti.  How disappointing.",1,,False,,
"Love this place!  Was in phoenix 3 weeks for work.  Ate here 3 times.  The squid salad is amazing!  They also have sushi, bibimbap, and tons of other items.  Must try!",5,,False,,
"This hotel is in a good location for getting to the sports venues downtown, the convention center or to just be in the heart of the city. Granted, it is about a 7 block walk to most of those places, but the lower price and FREE parking definitely make it worthwhile. I usually stay in Scottsdale when i am here for spring training, but I was here for a conference and walked to the convention center each day with no problems. It made sense to be downtown instead of Scottsdale. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice and big and the free breakfast is decent. I did not visit the pool, so I cannot comment on it. Someone mentioned the area being shady, i walked to and from here at least twice a day including late night and never felt it was a bad area. Also, the review about passing cars was not an issue for me. I was on the street side and I'm a light sleeper. Maybe their window was open?  i do agree that you can hear your neighbors in the bathroom, slightly annoying. In, summary - this hotel is a great choice and if the need arises, I'd stay again.",4,,False,,
"I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices. The services is hit and miss but once i went in with three friends and we sat at the sushi bar and they saw we weren't getting service they grabbed our order right away. Happy hour is good and drinks aren't expensive anyhow so drinkers celebrate! Cherry roll (i do it without sauce), octopus, anything with their eels, i love the quality of salmon as well. The best part is that FOOD IS SERVED TILL 2AM!!",4,,False,,
Awesome if you like ramen...even awesomer if you like boba tea!!!,4,,False,,
"Great place for a ""home office"" morning. One of my favorite places - indoor & outdoor seating. Always busy - they offer breakfast & lunch, their food is awesome! Very generous portions.",5,,False,,
"1 star for service, but the food is not ok :( they literally put 4 pieces of chicken on my taco. I let that go & figured was a mistake. When I went again, ordered different item & same result. Little to no meat. I will not be going back.",1,,False,,
"Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasn't a long wait at all. Highlights: spinach and artichoke dip, onion rings, and tortilla soup. Total tab was only $160 for the whole group.",4,,False,,
"This place is great!
If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.
You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere.
With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating.
They have a great happy hour prices! 
Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)",5,,False,,
Air Jordan! need I say more?,3,,False,,
"There are many other reviews which extol the virtues of this location. I just wanted to add some of my experiences as well as a few observations.

First off, at the time of this writing I've been in Phoenix for about a year. Learning about all the necessary places to go in a new town, I had the opportunity to rate businesses objectively (not like 'My mom always went there so I do too...')

Fry's became a standard 'go to' place. Their hours are great (5 AM to 1 AM). There are many locations, and their prices are very competitive. They also have a convenient VIP card and electronic coupon program.

Specifically to my needs, this location has a good pharmacy, an organic/health selection and a well stocked bakery and deli (for parties and special occasions). Their parking is reasonable and the lot is well kept/secure. There's also a Chase branch nearby as well as a Best Buy, Staples and Old Navy. On Wednesdays there's a Farmer's Market just across the street for everything else I can't find here.

Not all Fry's carry the same things. For instance, I can only depend on this location to carry pita bread, garlic naan, large Fage yogurt as well as the Mexican version of creme fraiche. I appreciate this greatly.

One word of caution, be firm with the staff at the deli. Take a number, insist on their attention, and don't let them gyp you with small wings or the bottom of the pasta selection. I know some of them don't care about their job, but don't let that ruin your experience. Remember: they're probably making minimum wage.

Oh, and the other reviewer's comment about the parking is accurate, although I'm not sure what they can do about it as this is a mall complex.",4,,False,,
"TJ was there for me when my water heater broke and started flooding my garage.  He walked me through fixing it over the phone until he was able to send some help to my house.  Very grateful, and I will continue referring!",5,,False,,
"So I was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since it's President Obama's favorite... 
The burger was good. Not great, not bland, just okay. My biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices! Skip the beverage... it's very over priced. I was also not impressed with the fries- regular or cajun. They were pretty average as well. Stick with the burger and skip the rest is my suggestion to you.",2,,False,,
"I really don't consider myself a Neiman's type of girl...
As a matter of fact, I don't really feel comfortable in Neiman's - it's extremely 'fancy' and high end for me.  But, I've gone in a handful of times and even bought a dress or two on sale at Neiman's in the past.  I admit, the quality associated with the designer labels at this store is pretty amazing.

Anyways, I felt some major pressure to register at Neiman's from my mom, so I met my mother-in-law-to-be at this Neiman's location on Sunday.  The housewares / registry department is extremely small... and although the woman working was sweet, she botched the spelling of Jared's name in the process.  Needless to say, i was not so impressed.

Fancy sums this department store up in my eyes - I'm much more of a Nordstrom's or Macy's or Bloomingdales type of girl!",4,,False,,
"I have been trying to reduce my caloric intake and found out that at Red Robin you can order a ""petite"" burger. It is smaller but has the same toppings you order on the regular. So for those of you that don't want to have a burger that is 1000 calories (yes they are and more with the endless fries) , try the petite.",4,,False,,
Great pizza and awesome must have guacamole pizza appitizer!!!!,5,,False,,
"This is a quaint little airport which is very convenient if you are travelling to the Tempe/Mesa area, or already know people who live there.  I say it's convenient-- if you are flying in from Grand Island or Grand Forks or Rapid City or East Bugtussel, since the only commercial tenant at this decomissioned air force base is Allegiant Airlines, which specializes in flying you from nowhere to somewhere (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Orlando that sort of thing).  

But from landing to sitting in my rental car it was maybe 20 minutes tops and I was heading out to lunch in the Phoenix area (don't bother with purchasing the ""snacks"" on the flight, just make sure you are prepared beforehand).",5,,False,,
"Headed back to Lobby's. How I missed this tasty burger. I wasn't disappointed with round 2. The burger was still fantastic! I'm also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip. 

With any burger purchase, getting the combo pack (fries/soda) is the smart choice.

I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.

Make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down. The burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun. That's a good thing in my opinion!",5,,False,,
"Simple but really great cajun food prepared in steamers right in front of you.  Selections include gumbo, pan roasts (a tomato-based broth with chunks of seafood), or seafood creole all with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, crawfish, oysters, or all five, with rice. They also have fresh oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktails, salads, and tasty seafood chowder, as well as the occasional lobster special. I've been probably 20 times and still never had a bad dish. The staff is friendly and helpful, and will adjust the spiciness of the dishes to your taste. By far the best option at the Talking Stick resort.

As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is really just a bar with a couple of tables, stuck right off the casino floor. This is definitely not a fine dining spot, with the clanging of slot machines and dead-eyed gamblers shuffling around fifteen feet away. Still, it's definitely worth a visit to Talking Stick. At $10-12 for lunch portions and $17-19 for huge dinner servings, and $25 for a massive platter of oysters, shrimp, crab, mussels, and clams, it's a fantastic value for the quality and tastiness of the food.  Good, reasonably priced seafood can be hard to come by in the valley, but this spot is a gem.",5,,False,,
"Staff was very rude, bowling prices weren't displayed to the best of their ability, extreme bowling itself was over priced almost $20 per person. The only thing about their extreme bowling was that it was extremely hot, temperature wise. they had many ceiling fans and not one of them turned on. And the bowling equipment malfunctioned three times during our games. It was not a pleasant experience and I don't believe we'll be going to this facility again.",1,,False,,
"The staff is really helpful.  I arrived without credit card due to a travel mishap and they were great about providing assistance to get me to a bank to help clear things up.  Their bell staff is friendly and knowledgable.  They can and will get you anywhere in town.  

Room was okay.  Clean, well furnished and updated.  I had a window overlooking the courtyard and I would recommend avoiding that.  It can get a little loud at night.  

Banquet food was good.  Not great, but good and plentiful.  Good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes.  A few of the items were a little salty for my taste but with a buffet style service, if something didn't suit, you could replace it with something else.  The break service was astonishing--they really go all out!  

If you are visiting during the right weather, do not miss the pool area.  It's fantastic!",4,,False,,
"Someone asked the question in the Yelp talk threads where the best place was for fried things, like french fries and onion rings.  Several people said Ted's had great onion rings......so off I went!  

I expected a smaller place but I was pleasantly suprised when I pulled up to a medium sized store.  I was greated with a smile and asked what I would like.  It was a Sunday afternoon so they were not very busy.  I liked the fact that you tell them what you want and they toss it on the grill right in front of you.  Everything is freshly cooked.  They did the same with the onion rings and french fries too.  Everything was fresh and hot.  My daughter had her favorite....a hot dog, which she loved, and fries which were fresh and crisp.  I had a burger and onion rings.  Yes, the onion rings were delicious!  The batter was great and the onions were a little on the sweet side.  My burger was cooked to perfection.  

This is another great little place we will go back to.  It's also sort of near my work so maybe I'll get out one day and go here for lunch.  Thanks Ted's and Yelpers!",4,,False,,
"After browsing at the Bookman's next door, we were feeling hungry and were tempted by the notion of tasty burritos.  We ended up getting non-burrito meals, but were fully satisfied with our entrees.  The green chile plate was filled with perfectly cooked pork with a spicy tomatillo sauce that went well with the pork.  The horchata tasted freshly made and was very refreshing and light.  Overall, I think Big Burrito is a good option for those that want a filling meal without breaking your wallet.",4,,False,,
Prices are often way too high!,1,,False,,
"I have been to this place twice so far.  The first time I had no idea what to expect since I never heard of it before.  I honestly have no idea what to compare it to but I guess the closest thing is Texas Road House judging by the reviews here on Yelp.  Anyway, I know its not the classiest joint with the best food, but anything is worth a fair shot.  The first time my wife and I went we were in the area doing some shopping and just wanted something quick and casual for dinner.  We didn't expect anything great but to be honest our expectations were exceeded.

The happy hour is pretty good.  $3 pints and 2 for 1 cocktails/wine.  Both times we went we ordered a 2 for 1 drink which would have been ok if they didn't charge too much for the first one.  I mean $5 for a small glass of Yellow Tail?  They are giving you 2 though so I can't complain too much I guess.

The thing we love about this place is the 2 meals for $13.99 special they have going on.  There are some pretty good options if you stay away from the fried stuff.  So far we have had the chop steak, steak and the salmon.  They are all very good and decently sized.  They prepare them however you want (sauce on the side, etc.) and everything comes with 2 sides.  There are 10 or so sides to choose from.  I get a side salad and some grilled onions or mushrooms to go with whatever meat I am having and they are always very good.  My wife always gets some sort of grilled vegetable and they are good as well. 

The service is very fast and friendly and the food always comes out pretty quick.  Oh yeah, and I also am a fan of their peanuts as well as the rolls that you get to start.",4,,False,,
"The wood saw is always out of service...
The garden department is nice, but the staff is a little strange.

This location never seems to be busy, so check out times are short. 
The prices are higher than ""another"" home improvement store just east on Baseline.

Meh.",2,,False,,
"I've never been to a restaurant where we (a party of 6 with a reservation) sat at a cleared table with no water, no bread, no cutlery, no service for 15 minutes before receiving a menu .... when we finally had someone provide a menu, it then took another 15 minutes to get the wine we ordered. 
Still no bread, still no food. 

The server dumped the wine bottle on the table (unopened), and went to find glasses. 10 minutes later she then threw the bottle opener at our table so we could open the wine ourselves while she went to find glasses. Most (!?!) of the wine glasses arrived within the next 10 minutes, and still no bread or food. 
Do I need to go on? 

And while the server apologized profusely, she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly disgruntled group. 

Food was fine -- the house-made burrata is quite remarkable. But not enough of a reason to return. Others we were with have had better experiences, and I would hope for the owner's sake that our dinner was an aberration...",2,,False,,
"My wife and I live around the corner, hadn't eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!",1,,False,,
"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

"Found this place by accident.  Not the greatest location.

The pulled pork rates about an 8 on my scale.  Didn't need sauce, but the sauce (sweet) was good.  The Ranch beans are a tad spicy but still good.  The slaw needs a little help.

I will definitely go back and sample the rest of the menu.",3,,False,,
"I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, it's in North Scottsdale so it's got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. I'm tellin' ya...it's good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so I'll rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I haven't eaten off the lunch menu...to me it's all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, I'm not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I can't go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump that's like $5,000...I guess that's where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell 'em Thomas sent ya",4,,False,,
"This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient subways I have EVER been to.  I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  Their employees are friendly and the food under the glass is fresh looking and appetizing and in their own bins.  Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. Thats what makes this Subway so great. Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  Absolutely I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately.",5,,False,,
"I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be ""New school"" or ""Traditional""   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating....
I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family.",5,,False,,
"Simply the best sandwiches I have ever tasted.

The Mozarella, Tomato, Basil is perfect. The focaccia bread is perfectly crunchy and slightly salted to the consummate texture.

"Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. 

About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. 
There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.
Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast",5,,False,,
"Great BBQ, although not a huge fan of the cafeteria style ordering. I have been twice, I got the brisket sandwich one time and ribs the next. Both were delicious. I added  bbq sauce to the ribs because I thought they needed it. Try the homemade root beer at least once, too. YUM. We got there just in time ( a bit before 6 on a Friday night)  as we were leaving the line was 3x as long...out the door and around the corner.  Oh FYI...for sides I got the beans (loved them) and my kids said the macaroni and cheese was good. Dad wasn't impressed with the coleslaw.",4,,False,,
Well I just wasted 38 bucks....never again,2,,False,,
"While staying at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio, we decided to eat here for our anniversary dinner. To sum it up, I've had everything better somewhere else. Nothing blew my socks off. 

Hubby is eating mostly vegetarian right now (due to a health concern), and he did really like his ""wild mushroom"" rigatoni. We weren't sure what was so ""wild"" about criminis and portobellos, but the pasta was in a light sauce with plenty of other veggies. His French Onion Soup was better at Capital Grille, my antipasto plate was far better at Craftsteak, and my ribeye was far better at 1130. They did serve a neat wedge of au gratin potatoes- multiple paper thin cheesy slices cut into a triangle. The gins are standard, but Hubby had a nice Bonny Doon Riesling. The free anniversary creme brulee was on the runny side, the vanilla was indiscernible, and the sugar crust was too thick- Ruth's Chris still wins that one in my book. Did I feel dinner was worth $120? Not so much.

The service at dinner was great, and it was fine at breakfast. Again, everything was decidedly mediocre and way overpriced. I've had a better Belgian waffle at IHOP, my bacon was limp, and the coffee not what I would expect from the Hilton. Hubby's BLT breakfast bagel was better.

Come on, Hilton! Is this the best you can do?",3,,False,,
"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.
Service was excellent, and highly attentive.
Food, absolutely horrible.

My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. 
What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. 
What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. 
Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick Filet
Veggies, blah.
Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. 

In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. 

I've had it with this place.
If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",1,,False,,
"Some of my friends brought me here last night and the first thing that came into my mind was that this was a set up for To Catch A Predator. I was ready for Chris Hansen to pop out and grill me with, ""What are you doing here?"" If you feel like Kubrick's Lolita really speaks to you, as in it mirrors your life, then you've found a place to feel comfortable in your pervert skin.

If you're of age to consume alcohol, they've got a bar here. The thing about this bar though is that they're really sloppy about pouring drinks, ie. a Manhattan should not taste like a barber's cleaning solution. The decor and set up of this place really needs a face lift.

A few pluses though... If you're under 21, I could see how this would be appealing. I'll admit that the under-21 clubs that I went to when I was under 21 were fun, but now that I think about them they really suck. It seems like an alright experience if this is your first step into the club/bar world. The DJ's here spin pretty much straight hip-hop which is fine, it's very mainstream though and nasty bumping music.

If you go here you're one of three types of people:

1) You were dragged here by your friends
2) You're under 21
or, 3) Your usual excuse is a heart-felt plea, complete with waterworks, that goes something along the lines of, ""I swear, Officer, I thought she was 18!!!!""",1,,False,,
"Uh-oh. Where am I? 

The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza. 

Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know. 

Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide. 

The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost. 

We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists. 

A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that. 

We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.

We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste. 

Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves. 

That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway. 

We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically. 

The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker. 

We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review.",3,,False,,
"Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting impression.  So does their desert plate...The service was wonderful and quick and attending to us.  Also, we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didn't seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming.  It is a bit pricey but i'm not sure you can expect anything less when going to a W Hotel.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience, cool atmosphere, doesn't mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food.",4,,False,,
"Decor  functional 
Staff friendly and are really kind to our toddler
food rocks  within my  limited range of  red and yellow curries ( so much so they suggested I try something else, hey it's not my fault these are so good that I didn't want to risk anything lesser. 

Prices are a bargain for entrees,  spice is there, they really get the request to make it very very hot.   This is probably the best bargain  in North Phoenix for  spice hounds",4,,False,,
"I was looking for a comforter for my new bed when I realized that this B,B, and B was close by so I stopped in to look around.  This is a nice store, It was organized well and the sales people were nice, not pushy.  I did not find a comforter but I did find several other things.  They have a nice selection of quality products and those 20% off coupons I get in the mail aren't bad either.  Prices can be a little high on some things but with that coupon they are about right.  I spent about an hour browsing through the store. They have a great knife section, coffee pots, food processor and all manor of kitchen gadgets too.  Just the kinds of things I love to look at.  I'm sure I will be back since it's in my ""hood"".  Thanks B,B, and B!",4,,False,,
"I had lunch today at CASK 63 with a banker to discuss our collective power to create business in the Phoenix Market. I HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST CRAB SALAD, I've had since leaving the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Red Crab Salad....fresh, clean, sweet, crisp..light...in a very well appointed setting. Very  good iced teas as well....hard to find in Phoenix.....Go there...Eat there...you will like it..and we might see one another...who knows...be like nike..just do it...:)",5,,False,,
"While I'm a sushi fan, my husband is a sushi FIEND - we made biweekly trips to his favorite haunt in NYC (Monster Sushi) and if he was on his own for dinner, I could always count on him to be there for a bite.  After relocating to Phoenix, he'd been jonesing hardcore for non-commercial, non-fussy sushi in epic proportions served with a smile.  Our trusted source told us that Kyoto was their favorite and we had to indulge.  The mixed views on Yelp made be a tad nervous, but I like to give places an unbiased chance.  Very glad that I did.

The interior of the place is a little strange given the shape of the restaurant and lack of windows, but we made ourselves cozy in a table next to the sushi bar.  I also did not notice a pre-club atmosphere - it was chill the night we went, but maybe it was because we went after work (which is probably on the earlier side for the see and be seens).

No teppan for us that night - it was all about the sushi.  We started with a pleasantly savory miso soup, flavorful seaweed salad and moist, tender tako (octopus) salad.  Next was my favorite dish of the night (and no, not traditional for sushi, but whatever) - a peppered, seared tuna with onion sauce.  Divine!  I could have had three plates of this and called it a day.  Most of the folks in our party ordered rather classic rolls, while I ordered an additional three specialty rolls (Candy Cane, Ichi and Shrimp Tempura - I love to crunch it out).  The rolls were so HUGE we struggled to eat it all.  Keep in mind that those specialty rolls are massive, particularly the Ichi (should have been called Ichi the Killer Roll) which you could barely eat with chopsticks.  I was a mess of dungeoness crab and spicy tuna by the end of the night, but I was happy.

Price was absolutely fair for the quality of the food - there are many (MANY) overprices sushi places in Scottsdale and many dirt cheap places in the valley.  This one charges fairly and keeps the quality up.  I don't ever mind paying if it's worth it.

Will most definitely come back and hopefully take in some teppan next time :)",4,,False,,
"If you have to be some place on time, don't use them.  I called at 2pm for a 4:15 taxi to arrive.  At 4:25 they were calling me saying he was right around the corner, and gave me his location.  Estrella called a couple more times to ""verify my address"".  At 4:35 I called them and cancelled the cab and got a ride from my neighbor.  As we pulled out of my neighborhood, we PASSED the cab. He had taken a street that he thought was going to be a through street and got himself lost. This is a TAXI service, they should know how to get around the valley!!  Don't these people use GPS, or MAPS at least?!?!?!?  End of story, I was still late for my class that I paid 250.00 bucks for. I was not allowed in, and the money is non refundable.  So thanks Estrella wasting my time and costing me money.  WORST TAXI SERVICE EVER.",1,,False,,
